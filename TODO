2019-02-02 [low] MCFRngdGroupModification, MCFSbstGroupModification

	Define the two classes above, deriving from GroupModification and having
	*nothing* different from GroupModification except the class name. Each time
	a GroupModification containing a set of abstract Modification corresponding
	to a given physical Ranged or Subset Modification, ensure that the
	GroupModification is the right one between MCFRngdGroupModification and
	MCFSbstGroupModification. Then, in map_forward_Modification() and/or
	guts_of_add_Modification() use this information to implement specialized
	treatment for these groups using a single call to the appropriate method
	rather than many calls.
