/// implementation of the Block concept for the (linear) Min-Cost Flow problem
/** The MCFBlock class implements the Block concept [see Block.h] for the
 * (linear) Min-Cost Flow (MCF) problem.
 *
 * The data of the problem consist of a (directed) graph G = ( N , A ) with
 * n = |N| nodes and m = |A| (directed) arcs. Each node `i' has a deficit
 * b[ i ], i.e., the amount of flow that is produced/consumed by the node:
 * source nodes (which produce flow) have negative deficits and sink nodes
 * (which consume flow) have positive deficits. Each arc `(i, j)' has an
 * upper capacity U[ i , j ] and a linear cost coefficient C[ i , j ]. Flow
 * variables X[ i , j ] represents the amount of flow to be sent on arc
 * (i, j). Parallel arcs, i.e., multiple copies of the same arc `(i, j)' are
 * in general allowed; it is expected that they have different costs (for
 * otherwise they can be merged into a unique arc), but this is not strictly
 * enforced. Multiple copies of some arc (i, j) can be seen as "total" flow
 * cost on that arc being a piecewise-linear convex function.
 *
 * The formulation of the problem is:
 * \f[
 *  \min \sum_{ (i, j) \in A } C[ i , j ] X[ i, j ]
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  \sum_{ (j, i) \in A } X[ j , i ] -
 *  \sum_{ (i, j) \in A } X[ i , j ] = b[ i ] \quad i \in N      (1)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *   0 \leq X[ i , j ] \leq U[ i , j ]   \quad (i, j) \in A      (2)
 * \f]
 * The n equations (1) are the flow conservation constraints and the 2m
 * inequalities (2) are the flow nonnegativity and capacity constraints.
 * At least one of the flow conservation constraints is redundant, as the
 * demands must be balanced (\f$\sum_{ i \in N } b[ i ] = 0\f$); indeed,
 * exactly n - ConnectedComponents( G ) flow conservation constraints are
 * redundant, as demands must be balanced in each connected component of G.
 *
 * The dual of the problem is:
 * \f[
 *  \max \sum_{ i \in N } Pi[ i ] b[ i ] -
 *       \sum_{ (i, j) \in A } W[ i , j ] U[ i , j ] -
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  Pi[ j ] - Pi[ i ] - W[ i , j ] + Z[ i , j ] = C[ i , j ]
 *  \quad (i, j) \in A                                           (3)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  W[ i , j ] \geq 0 \quad (i, j) \in A                         (4)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  Z[ i , j ] \geq 0 \quad (i, j) \in A                         (5)
 * \f]
 *
 * Pi[] is said the vector of node potentials for the problem, W[] are bound
 * variables and Z[] are slack variables. Given Pi[], the quantities
 * \f[
 *  RC[ i , j ] =  C[ i , j ] + Q[ i , j ] * X[ i , j ] - Pi[ j ] + Pi[ i ]
 * \f]
 * are said the "reduced costs" of arcs, and are basically the dual variables
 * of the box constraints.
 *
 * A primal and dual feasible solution pair is optimal if and only if the
 * complementary slackness conditions
 * \f[
 *  RC[ i , j ] > 0 \Rightarrow X[ i , j ] = 0                   (6)
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *  RC[ i , j ] < 0 \Rightarrow X[ i , j ] = U[ i , j ]          (7)
 * \f]
 * are satisfied for all arcs (i, j) of A.
 *
 * The graph G is allowed to be "partly dynamic". The sets of nodes and arcs
 * that are input at the beginning are assumed not to be changed (save for
 * changing costs, capacities, and deficits, and for arcs to be closed or
 * opened). Then, new arcs and nodes, up to a set maximum, can be dynamically
 * added or deleted. This means that the graph can be fully static (if the
 * maximum number of dynamic arcs and nodes is set to zero) as well as fully
 * dynamic (if the initial graph is empty). Note that deleting the very last
 * arc decreases the number of arcs, while deleting one "in the middle" just
 * leaves "a hole": the arc "is not there" and any newly created arc can
 * "take its name", but the reported total number of arcs do not change.
 *
 * Note that changing costs, capacities and deficits is also allowed via the
 * abstract representation. Similarly, opening and closing arcs can be
 * performed by unfixing and fixing (respectively) the corresponding flow
 * variable. However, all other operations require "complex work" on the
 * abstract representation and therefore cannot be performed via that. One
 * could in principle allow it provided that all the Modification be grouped
 * in a GroupModification allowing to check that all the necessary operations
 * to, say, create and delete one arc have been properly done in the
 * abstract representation, but this is not implemented yet (and it's
 * doubtful it ever will). Thus, adding/removing Variable to flow
 * conservation constraints, or even changing their coefficients, via the
 * abstract representation is not allowed, as is (not) adding/removing
 * dynamic Constraint (be them flow conservation or bound ones). Similarly,
 * deleted arcs "in the middle" correspond to flow variables fixed to 0,
 * which cannot be unfixed via the abstract representation. In all these
 * cases, exceptions will be thrown. */

/*---------------------------- PUBLIC TYPES --------------------------------*/
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/** @name Public types
 *
 * MCFBlock defines three main public types:
 *
 * - FNumber, the type of flow variables, arc capacities, and node deficits;
 *
 * - CNumber, the type of flow costs, node potentials, and arc reduced costs;
 *
 * - FONumber, the type of objective function value.
 *
 * By re-defining the types in this section, some (but not all) solution
 * algorithms may be able to work with the "smallest" choice of data type 
 * that is capable of properly representing the data of the instances to be
 * solved. This may be relevant due to an important property of MCF problems:
 * *if all arc capacities and node deficits are integer, then there exists an
 * integral optimal primal solution*, and *if all arc costs are integer,
 * then there exists an integral optimal dual solution*. Even more
 * importantly, *many solution algorithms will in fact produce an integral
 * primal/dual solution for free*, because *every primal/dual solution they
 * generate during the solution process is naturally integral*. Therefore,
 * one can use integer data types to represent everything connected with
 * flows and/or costs if the corresponding data is integer in all instances
 * one needs to solve. This directly translates in significant memory savings
 * and/or speed improvements.
 *
 * However, while using a MCFBlock as a part of some larger problem, it may
 * be difficult to fully exploit this property: even if some Solver can
 * exploit it, not all of them may be able to (one example are Interior-Point
 * approaches, which require both flow and cost variables to be continuous),
 * and maybe some other aspects of the overall solution algorithm will require
 * general double data anyway. One should actually have Block template over
 * all these types to be able to fully exploit this property, which may be a
 * future evolution but is not what this implementation does. The current
 * choice is to use the "worst case scenario" where FNumber == CNumber ==
 * OFNumber == double, although the data types are left there and it is
 * therefore in principle possible to change this. Note, however, that the
 * above integrality property only holds for *linear* MCF problems. Should
 * the class be extended, by even allowing arc costs to be convex quadratic
 * (the simplest possible nonlinear extension), then a single arc with a
 * nonzero quadratic cost coefficient implies that optimal flows and
 * potentials may be fractional even if all the data of the problem
 * (comprised quadratic cost coefficients) is integer. Hence, for such a
 * setting FNumber == CNumber == OFNumber == double is actually *mandatory*,
 * for any reasonable algorithm will typically misbehave otherwise.

  *
  * Regarding the bound constraints, these have fixed 0 LHS and a generic RHS,

  *   and it is a SimpleConfiguration< int >;
  *
  * - the f_value of the SimpleConfiguration< int > is != 0
  *
  * the bound constraints are not implemented. Note that this *makes it
  * impossible to change any RHS*; the lower bound of 0 should not be changed
  * anyway, and there is no upper bound to be changed. This is done
  * consistently for the dynamic and static part, i.e., either both of them
  * are created, or none is. Actually, each part is only created if the
  * corresponding set of static/dynamic Variable exists; yet, note that the
  * dynamic Variable are actually created if get_MaxNArcs() >
  * get_NStaticArcs(), and thus the same is done for their dynamic bound
  * constraints (if they are created at all). This may mean that the list can
  * be empty when it is created (if get_MaxNArcs() > get_NArcs() =
  * get_NStaticArcs()); this is done because new dynamic arcs can be created
  * any time, and the list of dynamic bound Constraint is there ready for when
  * this happens.
  *
  * Note that it is only allowed to change the bounds of the LB0Constraint
  * (if any) and both bounds of the FRowConstraint (at the same time, and to
  * the same value): changing *any* the parts of any of the FRowConstraint,

 /// generate the objective of the MCF
 /** Method that generates the objective of the MCF. Although this would seem
  * to be an exceedingly simple object, there is still a nontrivial decision
  * to be made about it, i.e., whether it is represented as a "sparse"
  * LinearFunction or a "dense" one. This is governed by objc: if
  *
  * - either objc is not nullptr and it is a SimpleConfiguration< double >;
  *
  * - or f_BlockConfig is not nullptr,
  *   f_BlockConfig->f_objective_Configuration is not nullptr,
  *   and it is a SimpleConfiguration< double >;
  *
  * then the f_value of the SimpleConfiguration< int > is taken as the "sparsity
  * parameter" (sprs) of the objective function; otherwise, sprs == 0. The
  * parameter is used as follows: if the number of nonzero arc cost
  * coefficients (at the time in which the method is called) is >=
  * sprs * get_NArcs(), then the LinearFunction in the objective is created
  * "dense": each flow Variable is "active" in it, even if it has a zero cost
  * coefficient. Otherwise, the LinearFunction in the objective is created
  * "sparse": only flow Variable with nonzero coefficient are "active" in it.
  * A "dense" Objective makes it much easier to change the cost coefficients
  * (see chg_cost[s]()), but it comes at the cost of more memory. Besides,
  * Solver using it and "trusting" the MCFBlock about how many nonzeroes are
  * there in the LinearFunction may be sorely disappointed, which may have
  * adverse effects on efficiency.
  *
  * Yet, a "dense" Objective is the default, as with sprs == 0 the Objective
  * is created "dense" even if all arc cost coefficients are zero.
  *
  * Note that the decision is taken at the moment in which this method is
  * called, and never changed later, even if the number of nonzeroes
  * changes dramatically. Also, note that if all cost coefficients are
  * "naturally" nonzero, then the Objective will be "dense" no matter what the
  * value of sprs is. Although this may seem obvious, this also means that the
  * Objective will remain "dense" even if later on many coefficients become
  * zero.
  *
  * IMPORTANT NOTE: ALLOWING SPARSE Objective MAKES IT INORDINATELY MORE
  * DIFFICULT TO REACT TO ABSTRACT Modification, WHILE ITS ACTUAL IMPACT ON
  * PERFORMANCES IS VERY DUBIOUS. THEREFORE, THE SUPPORT FOR IT IS ONLY
  * HALF-BAKED, AND WHATEVER THERE IS CURRENTLY COMMENTED OUT. DEVELOPMENT
  * OF THIS FEATURE WILL ONLY BE RESUMED IF CLEAR PROOF OF ITS WORTHINESS
  * IS ACHIEVED.
  *
  * The consequence is that, currently, THE ONLY Modification POSSIBLE TO THE
  * Objective ARE CHANGING THE COEFFICIENTS: DELETING Variable (AND,
  * THEREFORE, ADDING THEM) IS NOT ALLOWED, the MCFBlock will throw exception
  * while processing the corresponding "abstract" Modification. */

/*--------------------------- GENERAL NOTES --------------------------------*/
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/// a solution of a MCFBlock
/** The MCFSolution class, derived from Solution, represents a solution of a
 * MCFBlock, i.e.:
 *
 * - an m-vector of FNumber for the arc flow values;
 *
 * - an n-vector of CNumber for the node potentials;
 *
 * where m is the number of arcs and n is the number of nodes in the graph.
 * This means that
 *
 *       THE REDUCED COSTS ARE NOT EXPLICITLY SAVED
 *
 * This is OK for feasible dual solutions, as the dual variables of the bound
 * constraints (a.k.a. Reduced Costs) can be cheaply computed out of the
 * potentials. This may not be appropriate in all cases, as one may want to
 * deal with unfeasible dual solutions; if this will ever be the case, the
 * MCFSolution class will have to be changed accordingly.
 *
 * Note that the vectors are (in principle, both) optional: a MCFSolution
 * may have them empty, according to how it is created by a call to
 * MCFBlock::get_Solution(). If a vector is empty it is never read() or
 * write()-n from/to the MCFBlock. There is no support for changing this
 * during the life of the MCFSolution.
 *
 * It is useful to remark that some special cases of MCF would actually have
 * "special" solutions ("less general" ones in the parlance of Solution). In
 * particular:
 *
 * - if all capacities are Inf< FNumber >() and there is only one source or sink
 *   node, then the MCF problem is in fact a Shortest Path (sub-)Tree one, and
 *   its solutions can be represented by means of a predecessor function;
 *
 * - if all (finite) capacities and node deficits are integer, then there
 *   always exist optimal flow solutions of MCF that are integer;
 *
 * - if all arc costs are integer, then there always exist optimal potential
 *   solutions of MCF that are integer.
 *
 * Thus, MCFBlock would have scope for different kinds of Solution objects.
 * The currently implemented one is the "most general" one, so that the
 * Solution::scale() and Solution::sum() operations are always possible;
 * specialized Solution for the specific cases are left for future
 * development. */
